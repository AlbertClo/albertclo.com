            <p>Welcome to Brain-PACER: Brain Pacemaker Addiction Control to End Relapse study. This is a multicentre
                research
                study using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat severe alcohol or opioid addiction.
            </p>
            <p>DBS is safe, well-tolerated and effective for Parkinsonâ€™s disease and obsessive compulsive disorder. It
                has been
                approved by the FDA and CE-marked since 1997 for neurological disorders. Here we are using DBS for
                refractory
                addiction to treat craving and relapse. The study is a collaboration between the University of
                Cambridge, Kings
                College London and the University of Oxford.</p>
            <p>We are recruiting patients for the study.
            </p>
            <Heading2>Study Overview</Heading2>
            <Heading3>Objective</Heading3>
            <p>The primary aim of the Brain-PACER study is to explore the effects of DBS to treat alcohol and opioid
                addiction,
                providing new hope for individuals struggling with severe addictions. Our mission is threefold: to
                develop
                effective treatments for addiction, to understand the brain mechanisms that drive addiction, and to
                enhance the
                quality of life for individuals impacted by these disorders.
            </p>
            <Heading3>Importance</Heading3>
            <p>Addiction is a major public health issue. It is a significant challenge worldwide, impacting millions of
                lives.
                DBS, a well-established and FDA-approved treatment for conditions like Parkinsonâ€™s disease (1997),
                dystonia
                (2003), and severe OCD (2009), it is now being explored as a method for addiction treatment. Several
                small
                studies of DBS in addictions shows potential efficacy and safety. Our study aims to provide robust
                evidence for
                the efficacy of DBS in treating refractory addictions, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches
                and
                improving patient outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>What sets Brain-PACER apart is our commitment to leveraging the latest advancements in neurotechnology to
                develop
                real-time adaptive therapies for addiction. Our comprehensive study aims to track physiological signals
                to
                predict when cravings occur, allowing us to dynamically adjust DBS parameters. This approach can offer
                personalised and highly effective treatment options for individuals battling addiction, especially those
                who
                have not found relief with other therapies.
            </p>
            <Heading2>Our Approach</Heading2>
            <p>Addictions can be broadly thought of as an imbalance of an accelerator â€“ motivation and drive underlying
                addiction rewards, and impaired braking â€“ decision making, control and flexibility. The Brain-PACER
                study
                employs DBS stimulation to address this imbalance by delivering precise electrical stimulation to brain
                regions
                to regulate the neural circuits responsible for addictive behaviours.
            </p>
            <Heading2>Target Areas for Brain-PACER DBS</Heading2>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Nucleus Accumbens:</span> This region is crucial for motivation, processing
                    rewards and reinforcing behaviors. By modulating its activity, we aim to reduce the urge for
                    repeated
                    alcohol and drug use. This modulation can alter dopamine signalling, essential in the reward
                    pathway,
                    thereby helping to reduce cravings.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Ventral Internal Capsule:</span> This area contains pathways that connect
                    different parts of the brain involved in decision making and emotion. Stimulation here helps
                    regulate
                    decision-making and impulse control by linking the prefrontal cortex, responsible for higher-order
                    executive functions, with deeper brain structures involved in reward. Stimulation here addresses the
                    underlying neural mechanisms of addiction by improving impulse control and decision-making
                    processes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Stimulating these two areas aims to reduce cravings and improve control over addictive behaviours by
                modulating
                the brain circuits involved in reward, motivation and decision making.

            </p>
            <Heading2>How DBS Works</Heading2>
            <p>DBS is a neurosurgical treatment that involves implanting a slender electrode in the brain and a
                pacemaker under
                general anaesthesia. These electrodes deliver electrical impulses to modulate neural activity, which can
                help
                alleviate symptoms of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. DBS has been safely and
                effectively used
                since the late 1980s, with FDA and CE-marked approvals for several neurological and psychiatric
                disorders,
                ensuring its credibility and reliability as a treatment option.

            </p>
            <Heading3>Hereâ€™s how it works</Heading3>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Implantation:</span> During surgery, thin electrodes are carefully placed in
                    precise
                    locations in the brain. These locations are chosen based on the condition being treated. For
                    addiction, the
                    electrodes are placed in areas involved in reward, motivation and decision making.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Device Connection:</span> The electrodes are connected to a small
                    battery-powered
                    device called a pulse generator, which is usually implanted under the skin near the collarbone. This
                    device
                    sends electrical impulses to the brain.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Stimulation:</span> The electrical impulses from the pulse generator help
                    regulate
                    abnormal brain activity. In the case of addiction, these impulses may help reduce cravings and
                    improve
                    self-control by modulating brain circuits involved in these behaviours.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Adjustment:</span> After the surgery, doctors can adjust the settings of the
                    device
                    to ensure it provides the most benefit. This process is usually done through a wireless connection
                    to the
                    pulse generator.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This treatment is reversible and adjustable, making it a flexible option for managing chronic conditions.
                By
                understanding and harnessing the brainâ€™s electrical signals, DBS offers a way to improve the quality of
                life for
                many patients.
